This Java program acts as a REST API client, which means it communicates with a remote web server over the internet using HTTP requests, specifically to access public data provided by a RESTful web service.

The program performs the following steps:

1. Sends a GET Request:
It sends an HTTP GET request to a public REST API endpoint (e.g., weather API, joke API, etc.) using Java's built-in HttpClient.


2. Receives and Reads the Response:
The server responds with data in JSON format. This data is received as a string by the client program.


3. Parses the JSON Data:
The program uses a JSON parsing library (like Gson or org.json) to extract specific values from the JSON object — such as temperature, weather conditions, or jokes.


4. Displays the Result:
Finally, it prints the extracted data in a structured and readable format in the console — sometimes using colors or formatting for better presentation.

Output:
